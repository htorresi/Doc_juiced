          <b>Description:</b> The CIS Security Benchmarks program provides
          well-defined, un-biased and consensus-based industry best practices to
          help organizations assess and improve their security. The rules in
          this package help establish a secure configuration posture for the
          following operating systems: 
          - Windows Server 2012 R2 (CIS Benchmark for Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2, v2.2.0, Level 1 Member Server Profile) 
          - Windows Server 2016 (CIS Benchmark for Microsoft Windows Server 2016 RTM (Release 1607), v1.1.0, Level 1 Member Server Profile)
         If a
          particular CIS benchmark appears in a finding produced by an Amazon
          Inspector assessment run, you can download a detailed PDF description
          of the benchmark from https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/ (free
          registration required). The benchmark document provides detailed
          information about this CIS benchmark, its severity, and how to
          mitigate it.

        Description This policy setting enables or disables the Administrator
        account during normal operation. When a computer is booted into safe
        mode, the Administrator account is always enabled, regardless of how
        this setting is configured. Note that this setting will have no impact
        when applied to the domain controller organizational unit via group
        policy because domain controllers have no local account database. It can
        be configured at the domain level via group policy, similar to account
        lockout and password policy settings. The recommended state for this
        setting is: Disabled. Rationale In some organizations, it can be a
        daunting management challenge to maintain a regular schedule for
        periodic password changes for local accounts. Therefore, you may want to
        disable the built-in Administrator account instead of relying on regular
        password changes to protect it from attack. Another reason to disable
        this built-in account is that it cannot be locked out no matter how many
        failed logons it accrues, which makes it a prime target for brute force
        attacks that attempt to guess passwords. Also, this account has a
        well-known security identifier (SID) and there are third-party tools
        that allow authentication by using the SID rather than the account name.
        This capability means that even if you rename the Administrator account,
        an attacker could launch a brute force attack by using the SID to log
        on.

        example, if the secure channel between a member computer and the domain

        other local Administrator account, you must restart in safe mode to fix
        the problem that broke the secure channel.If the current Administrator
        password does not meet the password requirements, you will not be able
        to re-enable the Administrator account after it is disabled. If this
        situation occurs, another member of the Administrators group must set
        the password on the Administrator account with the Local Users and

        Description In May 2015, Microsoft released the Local Administrator
        Password Solution (LAPS) tool, which is free and supported software that
        allows an organization to automatically set randomized and unique local
        Administrator account passwords on domain-attached workstations and
        member servers. The passwords are stored in a confidential attribute of
        the domain computer account and can be retrieved from Active Directory
        by approved Sysadmins when needed. The LAPS tool requires a small Active
        Directory Schema update in order to implement, as well as installation
        of a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) on targeted computers.
        Please see the LAPS documentation for details. LAPS supports Windows
        Vista or newer workstation OSes, and Server 2003 or newer server OSes.
        LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to a
        domain. Note: Organizations that utilize 3rd-party commercial software
        to manage unique &amp; complex local Administrator passwords on domain
        members may opt to disregard these LAPS recommendations. Rationale Due
        to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many
        organizations choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or
        member servers when deploying them. This poses a serious attack surface
        security risk because if an attacker manages to compromise one system
        and learn the password to its local Administrator account, then they can
        leverage that account to instantly gain access to all other computers

      <div class="textBlock">
        In order to utilize LAPS, a minor Active Directory Schema update is
        required, and a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) must be
        installed on each managed computer. When LAPS is installed, the file
        AdmPwd.dll must be present in the following location and registered in
        Windows (the LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE installation does this for
        you): C:\Program Files\LAPS\CSE\AdmPwd.dll Impact: No impact. When
        installed and registered properly, AdmPwd.dll takes no action unless
        given appropriate GPO commands during Group Policy refresh. It is not a
        memory-resident agent or service.In a disaster recovery scenario where
        Active Directory is not available, the local Administrator password will
        not be retrievable and a local password reset using a tool (such as
        Microsoft's Disaster and Recovery Toolset (DaRT) Recovery Image) may be
        necessary.

        control mechanism to mitigate a security risk in Group Policy as part of
        MS15-011 / MSKB 3000483. This mechanism requires both the installation
        of the new security update and also the deployment of specific group
        policy settings to all computers on the domain from Vista/Server 2008 or
        higher (the associated security patch to enable this feature was not
        released for Server 2003). A new group policy template
        (NetworkProvider.admx/adml) was also provided with the security update.
        Once the new GPO template is in place, the following are the minimum
        requirements to remediate the Group Policy security risk:\\*\NETLOGON
        RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1\\*\SYSVOL
        RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1 Note: A reboot may be
        required after the setting is applied to a client machine to access the
        above paths. Additional guidance on the deployment of this security
        setting is available from the Microsoft Premier Field Engineering (PFE)
        Platforms TechNet Blog here: Guidance on Deployment of MS15-011 and
        MS15-014.

        "OneDrive.admx/adml" before adding it to your ADMX repository or Central
        Store, so both versions can coexist. Likewise, ensure that any Windows
        8.1/2012R2 versioned template is named "SkyDrive.admx/adml" before
