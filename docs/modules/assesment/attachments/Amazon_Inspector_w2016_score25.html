          <b>Description:</b> The CIS Security Benchmarks program provides
          well-defined, un-biased and consensus-based industry best practices to
          help organizations assess and improve their security. The rules in
          this package help establish a secure configuration posture for the
          following operating systems: 
          - Windows Server 2012 R2 (CIS Benchmark for Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2, v2.2.0, Level 1 Member Server Profile) 
          - Windows Server 2016 (CIS Benchmark for Microsoft Windows Server 2016 RTM (Release 1607), v1.1.0, Level 1 Member Server Profile)
         If a
          particular CIS benchmark appears in a finding produced by an Amazon
          Inspector assessment run, you can download a detailed PDF description
          of the benchmark from https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/ (free
          registration required). The benchmark document provides detailed
          information about this CIS benchmark, its severity, and how to
          mitigate it.

        Description In May 2015, Microsoft released the Local Administrator
        Password Solution (LAPS) tool, which is free and supported software that
        allows an organization to automatically set randomized and unique local
        Administrator account passwords on domain-attached workstations and
        Member Servers. The passwords are stored in a confidential attribute of
        the domain computer account and can be retrieved from Active Directory
        by approved Sysadmins when needed. The LAPS tool requires a small Active
        Directory Schema update in order to implement, as well as installation
        of a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) on targeted computers.
        Please see the LAPS documentation for details. LAPS supports Windows
        Vista or newer workstation OSes, and Server 2003 or newer server OSes.
        LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to a
        domain. Note: Organizations that utilize 3rd-party commercial software
        to manage unique &amp; complex local Administrator passwords on domain
        members may opt to disregard these LAPS recommendations. Note #2: LAPS
        is only designed to manage local Administrator passwords, and is
        therefore not recommended (or supported) for use directly on Domain
        Controllers, which do not have a traditional local Administrator
        account. We strongly encourage you to only deploy the LAPS CSE and LAPS
        GPO settings to member servers and workstations. Rationale Due to the
        difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many organizations
        choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or Member
        Servers when deploying them. This creates a serious attack surface
        security risk because if an attacker manages to compromise one system
        and learn the password to its local Administrator account, then they can
        leverage that account to instantly gain access to all other computers
        that also use that password for their local Administrator account.
      </div>
      <div class="details_h2">Recommendation</div>
      <div class="textBlock">
        In order to utilize LAPS, a minor Active Directory Schema update is
        required, and a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) must be
        installed on each managed computer. When LAPS is installed, the file
        AdmPwd.dll must be present in the following location and registered in
        Windows (the LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE installation does this for
        you): C:\Program Files\LAPS\CSE\AdmPwd.dll Impact: No impact. When
        installed and registered properly, AdmPwd.dll takes no action unless
        given appropriate GPO commands during Group Policy refresh. It is not a
        memory-resident agent or service.In a disaster recovery scenario where
        Active Directory is not available, the local Administrator password will
        not be retrievable and a local password reset using a tool (such as
        Microsoft's Disaster and Recovery Toolset (DaRT) Recovery Image) may be
        necessary.
