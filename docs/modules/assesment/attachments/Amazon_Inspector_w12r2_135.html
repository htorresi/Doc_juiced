          well-defined, un-biased and consensus-based industry best practices to
          help organizations assess and improve their security. The rules in
          this package help establish a secure configuration posture for the
          following operating systems: - Windows Server 2012 R2 (CIS Benchmark
          for Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2, v2.2.0, Level 1 Member Server

        Description This policy setting allows other users on the network to
        connect to the computer and is required by various network protocols
        that include Server Message Block (SMB)based protocols, NetBIOS, Common
        Internet File System (CIFS), and Component Object Model Plus (COM+).
        Level 1 - Domain Controller. The recommended state for this setting is:
        Administrators, Authenticated Users, ENTERPRISE DOMAIN CONTROLLERS.Level
        1 - Member Server. The recommended state for this setting is:
        Administrators, Authenticated Users. Rationale Users who can connect
        from their computer to the network can access resources on target
        computers for which they have permission. For example, the Access this
        computer from the network user right is required for users to connect to
        shared printers and folders. If this user right is assigned to the
        Everyone group, then anyone in the group will be able to read the files
        in those shared folders. However, this situation is unlikely for new
        installations of Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1), because
        the default share and NTFS permissions in Windows Server 2003 do not
        include the Everyone group. This vulnerability may have a higher level
        of risk for computers that you upgrade from Windows NT 4.0 or Windows
        2000, because the default permissions for these operating systems are
        not as restrictive as the default permissions in Windows Server 2003.

        computer from the network user right on domain controllers for all
        users, no one will be able to log on to the domain or use network
        resources. If you remove this user right on member servers, users will
        not be able to connect to those servers through the network. Successful
        negotiation of IPsec connections requires that the initiating machine
        has this right, therefore it is recommended that it is assigned to the
        Users group. If you have installed optional components such as ASP.NET
        or Internet Information Services (IIS), you may need to assign this user
        right to additional accounts that are required by those components. It
        is important to verify that authorized users are assigned this user
        right for the computers they need to access the network.

        Back up files and directories user right. The recommended state for this
        setting is: Administrators. Rationale An attacker with the Restore files
        and directories user right could restore sensitive data to a computer
        and overwrite data that is more recent, which could lead to loss of
        important data, data corruption, or a denial of service. Attackers could
        overwrite executable files that are used by legitimate administrators or
        system services with versions that include malicious software to grant
        themselves elevated privileges, compromise data, or install backdoors
        for continued access to the computer. Note: Even if the following
        countermeasure is configured, an attacker could still restore data to a
        computer in a domain that is controlled by the attacker. Therefore, it
        is critical that organizations carefully protect the media that are used
        to back up data.

        periodic password changes for local accounts. Therefore, you may want to
        disable the built-in Administrator account instead of relying on regular
        password changes to protect it from attack. Another reason to disable
        this built-in account is that it cannot be locked out no matter how many
        failed logons it accrues, which makes it a prime target for brute force
        attacks that attempt to guess passwords. Also, this account has a
        well-known security identifier (SID) and there are third-party tools
        that allow authentication by using the SID rather than the account name.
        This capability means that even if you rename the Administrator account,

        receive the GPO settings cannot receive subsequent Group Policy updates
        unless you create and deploy an outbound rule that enables Group Policy

        people believe that it is prudent to block all outbound connections
        except those specifically approved by the user or administrator.
        Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking outbound connections by
        default will force users to deal with a large number of dialog boxes

        browser or instant messaging software. Additionally, blocking outbound

        Description In May 2015, Microsoft released the Local Administrator
        Password Solution (LAPS) tool, which is free and supported software that
        allows an organization to automatically set randomized and unique local
        Administrator account passwords on domain-attached workstations and
        member servers. The passwords are stored in a confidential attribute of
        the domain computer account and can be retrieved from Active Directory
        by approved Sysadmins when needed. The LAPS tool requires a small Active
        Directory Schema update in order to implement, as well as installation
        of a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) on targeted computers.
        Please see the LAPS documentation for details. LAPS supports Windows
        Vista or newer workstation OSes, and Server 2003 or newer server OSes.
        LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to a
        domain. Note: Organizations that utilize 3rd-party commercial software
        to manage unique &amp; complex local Administrator passwords on domain
        members may opt to disregard these LAPS recommendations. Rationale Due
        to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many
        organizations choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or
        member servers when deploying them. This poses a serious attack surface
        security risk because if an attacker manages to compromise one system
        and learn the password to its local Administrator account, then they can
        leverage that account to instantly gain access to all other computers
        that also use that password for their local Administrator account.
      </div>
      <div class="details_h2">Recommendation</div>
      <div class="textBlock">
        In order to utilize LAPS, a minor Active Directory Schema update is
        required, and a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) must be
        installed on each managed computer. When LAPS is installed, the file
        AdmPwd.dll must be present in the following location and registered in
        Windows (the LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE installation does this for
        you): C:\Program Files\LAPS\CSE\AdmPwd.dll Impact: No impact. When
        installed and registered properly, AdmPwd.dll takes no action unless
        given appropriate GPO commands during Group Policy refresh. It is not a
        memory-resident agent or service.In a disaster recovery scenario where
        Active Directory is not available, the local Administrator password will
        not be retrievable and a local password reset using a tool (such as
        Microsoft's Disaster and Recovery Toolset (DaRT) Recovery Image) may be
        necessary.

        Description Windows includes a grace period between when the screen
        saver is launched and when the console is actually locked automatically

        period that is allowed for user movement before the screen saver lock
        takes effect is five seconds. If you leave the default grace period
        configuration, your computer is vulnerable to a potential attack from
        someone who could approach the console and attempt to log on to the

        (optionally) also be set to enable SMB encryption. However, using SMB
        encryption will render the targeted share paths completely inaccessible
        by older OSes, so only use this additional option with caution and
        thorough testing. Rationale In February 2015, Microsoft released a new
        control mechanism to mitigate a security risk in Group Policy as part of
        MS15-011 / MSKB 3000483. This mechanism requires both the installation
        of the new security update and also the deployment of specific group
        policy settings to all computers on the domain from Vista/Server 2008 or
        higher (the associated security patch to enable this feature was not
        released for Server 2003). A new group policy template
        (NetworkProvider.admx/adml) was also provided with the security update.
        Once the new GPO template is in place, the following are the minimum
        requirements to remediate the Group Policy security risk:\\*\NETLOGON
        RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1\\*\SYSVOL
        RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1 Note: A reboot may be
        required after the setting is applied to a client machine to access the

        Rationale When a software component suffers from a memory corruption

        corrupting these structures in a controlled manner, an exploit may be

        If you configure this policy setting to Enabled, the operating system
        will recognize when a network connection is available and then use the
        network connection to search Windows Update or your designated intranet
        site for updates that apply to them. After you configure this policy
        setting to Enabled, select one of the following three options in the
        Configure Automatic Updates Properties dialog box to specify how the
        service will work:- Notify before downloading any updates and notify
        again before installing them.- Download the updates automatically and
        notify when they are ready to be installed. (Default setting)-
        Automatically download updates and install them on the schedule
        specified below. If you disable this policy setting, you will need to
        download and manually install any available updates from Windows Update.
