== Executive summary

This report presents the results of the {audit-type} audit for {company-name} AWS Account {aws-account}, performed during the audit period {audit-period-aug}.

The recommendations provided in this report provide guidanance on the recommendations​ of the identified security risks. This document serves as an assesement of the security controls in place, for the given risk and compliance requirement for the company, and is based on the results of AWS Security Assessment Testing performed over the audit period. Evaluation ratings compare information gathered during the course of the engagement to “best in class” criteria for security standards. These security standards are based on:

- CIS AWS Foundation Benchmark 1.2, Level 2
- AWS consensus best-practices.  

We highly recommend to review section of Summary of Business Risks and High-Level and Recommendations for better understanding of risks and discovered security issues.

|[green]#A#
|Excellent
|The security exceeds “Industry Best Practice” standards. The overall posture was found to be excellent with only a few low-risk findings identified.

|Good
|The security meets with accepted standards for “Industry Best
Practice.” The overall posture was found to be strong with only a
handful of medium- and low- risk shortcomings identified.

|Fair
|Current solutions protect some areas of the enterprise from security issues. Moderate changes are required to elevate the discussed areas to “Industry Best Practice” standards

|[red]#D#
|Poor
|Significant security deficiencies exist. Immediate attention should be given to the discussed issues to address exposures identified. Major changes are required to elevate to “Industry Best Practice” standards.

|[red]#F#
|Inadequate
|Serious security deficiencies exist. Shortcomings were identified throughout most or even all of the security controls examined. Improving security will require a major allocation of resources.

== Assumptions & Constraints

As the environment changes, and new vulnerabilities and risks are discovered and made
public, an organization’s overall security posture will change. Such changes may affect the validity of this report. Therefore, the conclusion reached from our analysis only represents a “snapshot” in time.

Overview

This document provides prescriptive guidance for configuring security options for a subset of Amazon Web Services with an emphasis on foundational, testable, and architecture agnostic settings. Specific Amazon Web Services in scope for this document include:

 - AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
 - AWS Config
 - AWS CloudTrail
 - AWS CloudWatch
 - AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS)
 - AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)
 - AWS VPC (Default)

Audit Type:: {audit-type}
Accounts:: {aws-account} 
Audit period:: {audit-period-aug}

Consultants performed discovery process to gather information about the target and searched for information disclosure vulnerabilities. With this data in hand, we conducted the bulk of the testing manually, which consisted of input validation tests, impersonation (authentication and authorization) tests, and session state management tests. The purpose of this penetration
testing is to illuminate security risks by leveraging weaknesses  within the environment that leadto the obtainment of unauthorized access and/or the retrieval of sensitive information. The shortcomings identified during the assessment were used to formulate recommendations and mitigation strategies for improving the overall security posture.

== Results Overview     

The test uncovered a vulnerabilities that may cause sensitive data leakage, broken confidentiality and integrity and availability of the resource.
Identified vulnerabilities are exploitable and the risk posed by these vulnerabilities can cause damage to the application and company.

**CIS Benchmark 1.2 Level 2**

=== Summary of Business Risks

Medium and low severity issues can lead to:

- Attacks on communication channels and as a result on sensitive data leakage and
possible modification, in other words it affects the integrity and confidentiality of data transferred.
- Information leakage about system components which may be used by attackers for
further malicious actions.
- Attacks on old and not patched system components with bunch of publicly known
vulnerabilities.
- Enumerating existing users emails/usernames and brute forcing their passwords. Easy access to their session after exploitation of high level risks.
- Combination of few issues can be used for successful realisation of attacks.

Informational severity issues do not carry direct threat but they can be used to gather useful information for an attacker.


=== High-Level Recommendations

Taking into consideration all issues that have been discovered, we highly recommend to:

- Conduct current vs. future IT/Security program review
- Conduct Static code analysis for codebase
- Establish Secure SDLC best practices, assign Security Engineer to a project to monthly review code, conduct SAST & DAST security testing
- Review Architecture of application
- Deploy Web Application Firewall solution to detect any malicious manipulations
- Continuously monitor logs for anomalies to detect abnormal behaviour and fraud
transactions. Dedicate security operations engineer to this task
- Implement Patch Management procedures for whole IT infrastructure and endpoints of employees and developers
- Continuously Patch production and development environments and systems on regular bases with latest releases and security updates
- Conduct annual Penetration test and quarterly Vulnerability Scanning against internal and external environment
- Develop and Conduct Security Awareness training for employees and developers
- Develop Incident Response Plan in case of Data breach or security incidents
- Analyse risks for key assets and resources
- Update codebase to conduct verification and sanitization of user input on both, client and server side
- Use only encrypted channels for communications
- Do not send any unnecessary data in requests and cookies
- Improve server and application configuration to meet security best practises
